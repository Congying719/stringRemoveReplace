# stringRemoveReplace
an algorithm that could replace the same 3 letters to previous one or delete

characters are identical, remove them from the string. Repeat this process until 
there is no more than 3 identical characters sitting besides each other.

Instead of removing the consecutively identical characters, replace them with a 
single character that comes before it alphabetically.
